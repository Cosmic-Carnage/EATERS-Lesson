- An **[     ]** is a data structure used to implement a collection (list) of primitive or object reference data.

- An **[     ]** is a single value in the **[     ]**

- The __**[     ]**__ of an **[     ]** is the position of the element in the **[     ]**

    - In java, the **[     ]** of an array is at **[     ]**.

- The **[     ]** of an **[     ]** is the number of elements in the array.

    - **`[     ]`** is a `[     ]` data member of an array

        - Since `[     ]` is `[     ]`, we can access it in **[     ]**!

        - Since `[     ]` is `[     ]` we cannot change an array's `[     ]` after it has been created
    - In Java, the **[     ]** of an array named `[     ]` is at **[     ]** `[     ]`


```python

```
